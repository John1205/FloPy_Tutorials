./BakkerEtAl-2016: Figure 1 in Bakker et al. (2016) Groundwater
    -Steady-state, 1D, unconfined flow between two long canals
    -Fixed water level in canals of 20 m, separated by 2000 m
    -Bottom of aquifer at 0 m elevation, top of aquifer at 50 m elevation
    -Hydraulic conductivity 10 m/day
    -Groundwater recharge 1 mm/day
    -Two ditches parallel to canals with extraction rates of 1 m3/m/day, 500 m from L/R canal
